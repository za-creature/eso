# This project is *NOT* supported

It's a tech demo and it exists _solely_ to pad my resume; I don't care [^1]
about whatever bug or issue you came across while using it. The entire codebase
is less than 1k lines of code including comments and configs, so if you can't
solve the issue yourself, as far as I'm concerned you shouldn't be using it in
the first place.

I will not merge your pull requests either as doing so would undermine this
project's purpose, however I am happy to hear your thoughts in which case feel
free to delete all of the above and use this form to contact me. You can also
send me an e-mail; I'm not that hard to find, but I'll leave that up to you.
